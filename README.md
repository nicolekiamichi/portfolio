## Work Experience
### Senior Data Scientist
- Design two-group pretest-posttest statistical experiments to measure the effectiveness of the product on gas mileage and leverage statistical testing to evaluate the results of the experiments.
- Co-developed a reporting and sustainability platform for existing customers: provided data-driven insights and recommendations to the UI/UX team during development, automated the ETL process of terabytes of data, and developed proprietary algorithms and predictive models to produce meaningful insights for customers.
- Re-designed and automated the generation of prospective customer ROI reports (time reduction of 88%), automated daily reports and data syncs (time reduction of 80%), and automated existing customer reports (time reduction of 75%).

### Model Risk Review Specialist II
- Performed statistical assumption testing, stress-testing, and back-testing on ARIMA time series models and logistic regression credit risk models to validate model assumptions, ensure statistical soundness, and mitigate overall risk to the bank.
- Developed challenger models from scratch by performing feature selection, splitting data into test, train, and validation sets, selecting the model type, training, and validating the model. Used these results to challenge existing time series and credit risk models.
- Developed an automated model validation pipeline (R, Python) that reduced each validation project timeline by 40% and was adopted by the entire model risk team.
